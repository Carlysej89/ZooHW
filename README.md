ZooHW is a homework assignment where we are demonstrating knowledge by utilizing classes, constructors and methods.
In this assignment we should be able to create a new object(animal) in our "Zoo". We also create offspring and blueprint what makes
up the "Animal".In this updated version of ZooHW, however, we are using "Throw, try and catch" for error handling.
